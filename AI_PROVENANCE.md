# AI Collaboration & Provenance

This repository practices transparent AI-assisted engineering. We document the AI tools, models, prompts, and architectural decisions that shaped `fred.weather`.

## How to read this record

This repository follows the Tamlinux [AI provenance standard](https://github.com/greenermoose/tamlinux/blob/main/docs/ai-provenance-standard.md). In
brief: commits made with AI help carry `AI-Tool` and `AI-Model` trailers, and
each session record in [`docs/ai/`](docs/ai/) gives the date, tool version,
model, Fred's guiding prompts verbatim, the commits, and the decisions. Session
transcripts are retained privately by the author, so the records carry no
session IDs or local transcript paths.

## 1. Fred's Multi-Agent AI Toolchain

Rather than relying on a single AI model or interface, Fred uses a specialized toolchain tailored to each tool's strengths. CLI versions below reflect the environment captured during development (`<tool> --version`).

| Tool & Interface | CLI Version | Backing Models | Primary Role in the Ecosystem |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Claude Code** (`claude`) | `2.1.267` | Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) | **Architecture & System Planning**: Authoring durable system specifications, multi-step runbooks, and cross-cutting policies. |
| **Codex CLI** (`codex`) | `0.156.1` | `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-6-sol` | **Architecture & System Planning**: Second opinion on plans and specifications alongside Claude. |
| **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`) | `1.2.6` | Gemini 3.8 Flash (High) | **Coding, Refactoring & Implementation**: Primary coding partner for multi-file pair-programming, security remediation, bash/Python/QML engineering, and git release workflow. |
| **OpenCode** (`opencode`) | `1.18.30` | Big Pickle | **Distro & System Q&A**: Efficient lookups for Arch Linux / Omarchy package specifics and shell configuration, conserving frontier-model token budgets. |
| **Grok CLI** (`grok`) | `1.0.25` (`f7e67d6988e2`, stable) | Grok 4.6 | **Workstation Support**: Additional debugging, hardware diagnostics, and alternative implementation analysis. |

## 2. Key Architectural Milestones & AI Role

| Milestone | Version | Primary AI Partner | Key Decisions & Achievements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Initial Implementation & Focus Isolation** | `v1.0.0` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Designed multi-monitor focus-isolated weather panel with 48h timeline curve, 10-day forecast, Font Awesome Sun glyph (`\uf185`), hover tooltip briefing, and closed-environment security baseline. |
| **Location Header & Tooltip Reordering** | `v1.0.1` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Added city/state location formatting and reordered tooltip lines with version at bottom separated by blank line. |
| **Custom Hover Popup, IPC Control & Preview Assets** | `v1.0.2` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Implemented custom `PopupWindow` in `BarWidget.qml` with styled dimmed caption version footer, programmatic `showHover`/`hideHover` IPC methods, and HP monitor preview screenshot composite. |
| **Multi-Monitor Broadcast, Retry Hardening & Resume Sync** | `v1.0.3` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Added `refreshAll` and payload broadcast across monitors via `WeatherStore.js`, implemented `scheduleDailyForecastRetry()` with exponential backoff in `Panel.qml`, and wired resume hook in `msi-mp161-resume-workaround`. |
| **Daily Forecast Local Timezone Alignment** | `v1.0.4` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Fixed off-by-one daily forecast date bug where late-evening local time in western timezones rolled to UTC tomorrow; added `forecastTodayString`, cache rollover filtering, and dynamic today index resolution. |
| **v1.0.4 GitHub Release** | `v1.0.4` | Codex CLI `0.155.1` (`gpt-6-sol`) | Verified deployed/public runtime parity, tests, and manifest; prepared the release metadata without changing runtime code. [Session record](docs/ai/2026-09-23-release-v1.0.4.md). |

Detailed session logs and prompts are documented in [`docs/ai/sessions.md`](docs/ai/sessions.md).

## 2026-09-22 repository rename

Codex CLI `0.155.1` (`gpt-6-sol`) updated canonical GitHub links for `weather-fred-tamlinux`. [Session record](docs/ai/2026-09-22-github-repository-rename.md).

## 2026-09-22 Tamlinux branding

Cursor `3.21.16` (`composer`) replaced the current-facing `for Omarchy Linux` tagline with Tamlinux. Stock `omarchy.weather` wording is unchanged.

## 2026-09-23 upstream survey foundation

Codex CLI `0.156.1` (`gpt-6-sol`) established the root upstream reference
and dated survey directory for this repository. This was documentation only;
no field survey or runtime change was made.
[Session record](docs/ai/2026-09-23-upstream-survey-foundation.md).

## 2026-09-28 private session IDs

Claude Code `2.1.283` (`claude-opus-5-5`) removed session IDs and local
transcript paths from this repository's AI records and linked the public
provenance standard. Documentation only.
[Session record](docs/ai/2026-09-28-private-session-ids.md).
